R = Change/Volatility
Change = ABS(Close - Close (10 periods ago))
Volatility = Sum10(ABS(Close - Prior Close))
Volatility is the sum of the absolute value of the last ten price changes (Close - Prior Close).
SC = [ER x (fastest SC - slowest SC) + slowest SC]2
SC = [ER x (2/(2+1) - 2/(30+1)) + 2/(30+1)]2
Current KAMA = Prior KAMA + SC x (Price - Prior KAMA)
